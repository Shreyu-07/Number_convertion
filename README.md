# Number Conversion Python Program

This Python program converts numbers from one format to another, supporting conversions between binary, octal, hexadecimal, and decimal formats. It is user-friendly and runs in the command line, making it easy to perform basic number format conversions.

## Supported Conversions

1. **Binary to Decimal**: Converts a binary number (e.g., `1010`) to its decimal equivalent (`10`).
2. **Octal to Decimal**: Converts an octal number (e.g., `12`) to its decimal equivalent (`10`).
3. **Hexadecimal to Decimal**: Converts a hexadecimal number (e.g., `A`) to its decimal equivalent (`10`).
4. **Decimal to Binary**: Converts a decimal number (e.g., `10`) to its binary equivalent (`1010`).

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system (Python 3.x recommended).
2. Save the code to a file, e.g., `number_conversion.py`.
3. Run the program using the command:
   ```bash
   python number_conversion.py
